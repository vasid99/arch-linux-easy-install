# Arch Linux Easy Install
This is a set of scripts that I wrote after learning how to install Arch Linux. It is essentially taking the core commands from the [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) and condensing them into a script. I got irritated with doing all the steps after the 10th time I installed Arch by myself and thought this would be easier.

Who this is meant for:
- A novice just wanting to install and use Arch Linux without understanding it in depth
- An intermediate user like me who's tired of doing everything every single time

Who this is NOT meant for:
- An expert user. You clearly know more than me
- A novice/intermediate user who wants to learn what's going on behind the hood

I would also explicitly like to mention that though I find the whole process tedious now, I would not have my path to feeling like this be any other way. It is by doing the installation those 10 times earlier that I really learnt and understood what was happening here. The Arch wiki is a stellar source of information, not just about Arch Linux, but about Linux and UNIX-style systems in general, and anyone wanting to gain exposure to Linux internals would be well-served by going through the process.

## Usage
- Copy/Download the repo into your live USB
- Edit the configuration in `arch_env` to your liking
- Once done, run `arch_runme.sh` in the booted live USB.

Feel free to post issues, though I may not respond to them for a while
